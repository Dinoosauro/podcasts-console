# podcasts-console

Download podcast episodes directly from the console

## Installation

You can find pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases. Otherwise, you can clone
this repository, and then build it locally (`dotnet restore` to install the
dependencies; `dotnet publish` to generate the executables)

## How it works

The usage of this tool is really simple. Run it, paste the RSS feed and choose
the podcast episodes you want to download. The application will take care of
everything else

## Command-line arguments

You can pass lots of arguments in the command line to change the behaviour of
this application. You can find all of them in the following table:

`--url *FIRST URL* --download-index "0,2,5" --url *SECOND URL* --download-index "1,3,4`
